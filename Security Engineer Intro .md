# Security Engineer Intro 

**The Role of a Security Engineer**
Keeping in view the above-mentioned need for security, organizations hire security engineers. In order to hire a security engineer, an organization perceives a security engineer as someone who:

    Owns the overall security of an organization. The main person responsible for securing an organization's digital assets.
    Ensures that the organization's cyber security risk is minimized at all times.
    Devises strategies and creates systems that minimize the risk posed by cyber security threats to an organization.
    Periodically conducts tests to ensure the robustness of the cyber security posture of an organization, identifies weak points, and prepares mitigations.
    Develops and implements secure network solutions.
    Architects and engineers trustworthy, reliable, and secure systems.
    Collaborates and coordinates with other teams to establish security protocols across the organization.

**Qualifications Required for a Security Engineer**
As you might have noticed, the security engineer role mentioned above is very broad and might require a whole department instead of a single person. This is because this role is defined loosely and varies from organization to organization. An engineer takes large problems, breaks them down into smaller chunks, and then solves them. Therefore a security engineer is someone that follows this process for security problems. Meaning that even though you might have a job description, each day might be quite different since you are faced with various problems. Overall, when hiring a security engineer, organizations look for the following basic requirements:

    0-2 years of experience with IT administration, helpdesk, networks or security operations.
    Basic understanding of computer networks, operating systems, and programming.
    Basic understanding of security concepts such as Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC).


### a security engineer will often be responsible for the areas that follow
**Asset Management/Asset Inventory**
One of the primary steps in ensuring an organization's security is to maintain an organization's asset inventory. In terms of cyber security, this will mean managing and maintaining an inventory of an organization's digital assets. Security engineers can only own an organization's security if they know what assets the organization has. They must also ensure that this asset inventory is regularly maintained and updated and includes all the required information about assets such as asset name, type, IP addresses, physical location, place in the network, applications running on an asset, access permissions (only within the organization or public-facing), and the asset owner details.

**Security Policies**
An organization needs robust security policies to maintain a sound security posture. A security engineer helps the organization create security policies based on established Security Principles. These policies are then implemented organization-wide, and the security engineer ensures that the implementation follows the letter and spirit of the policies. Sometimes, a need arises for granting exceptions to the security policies due to business needs. In such scenarios, the security engineer consults the security principles to allow or deny exceptions and suggest mitigating steps to minimize risks. 
**Secure by Design**
A security engineer ensures that the organization is secure by design. The engineer understands that the security posture receives the most Return on Investment (ROI) if it follows a secure-by-design philosophy. This means that the security engineer takes steps to implement a Secure Network Architecture (room coming soon!), ensures the organization's Windows, Linux, and Active Directory are hardened, and software development follows the Secure Software Development Lifecycle.
**Security Assessment and Assurance**
While securely designing the organization's network and infrastructure might be an excellent first step, a security engineer understands that their job is far from done after that. They understand that security is hard work that requires continuous effort. While a security engineer must ensure everything is done correctly, a compromise requires just one loophole to be successful. To mitigate risks from a continuously evolving threat landscape, a security engineer plans to conduct regular security assessments, audits, and red-teaming and purple-teaming exercises to continuously improve the security posture. While security engineers might not be performing assessments and audits themselves, they are primarily involved in helping schedule these activities, creating Request for Quotations (RFQs) for external parties to perform these activities, and helping prioritize and implement the findings from them.

### Ensuring Awareness, Managing Risks, Change Management,Vulnerability Management, Compliance and Audits

- security engineers job starts after the policies are placed
- humans are building block and weak links in a business
- awareness sessions are like for se or sd or sna
- eliminating all risks might not be possible when running business operations
- Sometimes, a decision has to be made to accept a risk and move on
- Accepting or mitigating risks is often a business decision, and a security engineer acts as a trusted advisor of the management that helps them take this decision by providing subject matter expertise
- A security engineer might suggest mitigating the risk by hardening the OS through additional controls and adding a reverse proxy in front of the vulnerable system to avoid exposing it to the internet. While these steps will not eliminate the risk, they will significantly reduce it without affecting the organization's operations.
- epending on the industry, clientele, and location of the organization, it might be subject to various compliance standards such as PCI-DSS, HIPAA, SOC2, ISO27001, NIST-800-53, and more. A security engineer works closely with both internal and external auditors to detect any non-compliance issues and effectively address them.

### Managing Security Tooling, Tabletop Exercises, Disaster Recovery and Crisis Management

- Tabletop exercises are often conducted to gauge the operational readiness of an organization from a security point of view.
- A security engineer might sometimes be required to configure or fine-tune security tools such as SIEMs, Firewalls, WAFs, EDRs, and more
- A security engineer might be involved in disaster recovery, business continuity, and crisis management planning as part of the different compliance frameworks and the organization's internal policies.
