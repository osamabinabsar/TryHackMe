## SSRF, its risks and mitigation with practical examples





OWASP Ranking
SSRF is a formidable security threat, earning a spot in OWASP's top 10 list, making it imperative to understand and defend against it as it jeopardises data integrity and application security. As per OWASP, factors regarding SSRF are mentioned below:

Max Incidence Rate
	Avg Incidence Rate
	Avg Weighted Exploit    
	Avg Weighted Impact
	Max Coverage
	Total Occurrences
	Total CVEs
2.72%
	2.72%
	8.28
	6.72
	67.2%
	9503
	385

The above table provides insights into the prevalence, impact, and coverage of an SSRF vulnerability in a specific context or dataset that OWASP measures. The interpretation of the above table is explained below:

    Max Incidence Rate: It suggests how often this vulnerability has been encountered relative to other vulnerabilities in OWASP.
    Avg Incidence Rate: It shows how common this vulnerability is compared to others.
    Avg Weighted Exploit: Indicate the average difficulty or effort required to exploit an SSRF vulnerability.
    Avg Weighted Impact: Average potential impact or severity of exploiting an SSRF vulnerability.
    Max Coverage: It indicates how much of the systems have been exploited due to this vulnerability.
    Total Occurrences: Total exploitations due to this vulnerability that OWASP has analysed.
    Total CVEs: Total CVEs about SSRF. These are CVE-2021-21311, CVE-2018-11759 and CVE-2017-9506. This data of OWASP is from 2021.

Note: The SSRF vulnerability ranks 7th in the OWASP API Security Top 10.

Risk of SSRF
Data Exposure

As explained earlier, cybercriminals can gain unauthorised access by tampering with requests on behalf of the vulnerable web application to gain access to sensitive data hosted in the internal network.
Reconnaissance
An attacker can carry out port scanning of internal networks by running malicious scripts on vulnerable servers or redirecting to scripts hosted on some external server.

Denial of Service
It is a common scenario that internal networks or servers do not expect many requests; therefore, they are configured to handle low bandwidth. Attackers can flood the servers with multiple illegitimate requests, causing them to remain unavailable to handle genuine requests.






ï»¿Blind SSRF refers to a scenario where the attacker can send requests to a target server, but they do not receive direct responses or feedback about the outcome of their requests. In other words, the attacker is blind to the server's responses. This type of SSRF can be more challenging to exploit because the attacker cannot directly see the results of their actions. We will discuss its various examples.

### Blind SSRF With Out-Of-Band 

Out-of-band SSRF is a technique where the attacker leverages a separate, out-of-band communication channel instead of directly receiving responses from the target server to receive information or control the exploited server. This approach is practical when the server's responses are not directly accessible to the attacker.

For instance, the attacker might manipulate the vulnerable server to make a DNS request to a domain he owns or to initiate a connection to an external server with specific data. This external interaction provides the attacker with evidence that the SSRF vulnerability exists and potentially allows him to gather additional information, such as internal IP addresses or the internal network's structure.
