# Identity and Access Management

## IAAA Model
Identification, Authentication, Authorisation, and Accountability (IAAA) are four pillars of information security. Each of these elements plays an essential role in ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information and resources.

1. **Identification** is the process of verifying who the user is.
2. **Authentication** is the process of ensuring that the user is who they claim to be.
3. **Authorisation** determines what the user is allowed to access.
4. **Accountability** tracks user activity to ensure they are responsible for their actions. Accountability is possible if we have auditing capabilities, which usually require proper logging functionality.

_**Log forwarding** is the process of sending log data from one system to another. This process often aggregates log data from multiple sources into a central location for more accessible analysis and management. Log forwarding can also be used to send log data to a cloud-based service for storage and analysis._

_**Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** is a technology that aggregates log data from multiple sources and analyses it for signs of security threats. SIEM solutions can help organisations identify anomalies, detect potential security incidents, and provide alerts to security teams._

### Identity Managemetn

Identity Management (IdM) includes all the necessary policies and technologies for identification, authentication, and authorisation. IdM aims to ensure that authorised people have access to the assets and resources needed for their work while unauthorised people are denied access. IdM requires that each user or device is assigned a digital identity.

- IsM helps organizzaion protect sensetive data data and maintain compliance with regulations,to streamline user access process is, reduce costs, improve user experience.

Some sources refer to IdM and Identity and Access Management (IAM) interchangeably. Other sources consider IdM to be more focused on the security issues related to user identity, such as authentication and permissions. They state that IdM is concerned with managing the attributes and permissions of users, devices, and groups, while IAM is more concerned with evaluating the attributes and permissions and granting or denying access according to the company policy.

### IDM VS IAM

-------------
| IDM | IAM | 
|-----|--------|
| IdM is an essential component of cybersecurity that refers to the process of managing and controlling digital identities. It involves the management of user identities, their authentication, authorisation, and access control. The main goal of IdM is to ensure that only authorised individuals have access to specific resources and information. IdM systems are used to manage user identities across an organisationâ€™s network. | IAM is a more comprehensive concept than IdM. It encompasses all the processes and technologies to manage and secure digital identities and access rights. IAM systems include a variety of functions, such as user provisioning, access control, identity governance, and compliance management. IAM systems ensure that only authorised users have access to specific resources and data and that their access is monitored and controlled. |
| IdM systems use a centralised database to store user identities and access rights. They also provide functionalities to manage and monitor user access to resources. IdM systems generally include features such as user provisioning, authentication, and authorisation. User provisioning refers to the process of creating and managing user accounts, while authentication and authorisation refer to verifying the identity of a user and granting access to specific resources. | IAM systems provide a comprehensive solution to manage and secure access to resources in an organisation. They integrate with multiple systems and applications, providing a centralised view of user identities and access rights. IAM systems use various technologies to manage access, including role-based access control, multi-factor authentication, and single sign-on.|
| IdM systems are critical in organisations where there are multiple systems and applications that require access control. They help to simplify the management of user identities, reducing the risk of unauthorised access to resources. In addition, IdM systems provide a single point of reference for user identity management, which makes it easier for organisations to manage user access rights. | IAM systems help organisations comply with regulatory requirements such as HIPAA, GDPR, and PCI DSS. They provide functionalities to manage the lifecycle of user identities, including onboarding, offboarding, and access revocation. In addition, IAM systems allow organisations to track and audit user activity, which helps to prevent security breaches and ensure compliance with industry regulations. |

IdM and IAM are essential components of cybersecurity. They ensure that only authorised individuals have access to specific resources and information. IdM systems manage user identities, while IAM systems encompass broader functions to manage and secure digital identities and access rights.

### Attacks against Authentication
 - replay attacks are a threat

### Access control models

A system controls access to various resources based on the chosen model. Some of the common access control models are:

1. Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
3.  Mandatory Access Control (MAC) [AppArmor for Linux, SELinux]


### SSO
